# ![Scale-Up Velocity](./readme-files/logo-main.png) Pre Course Project - Todo List ðŸ“‹

This project will include most of the topics we have learnt so far.
This repository includes a basic skeleton template with automated tests, use it for your submissions.

In this project you will create a Todo List Web Application, in which the user can store prioritized _todo tasks_ and view/sort that list.

Here is a preview sample of the desired functionality (without styling):

## Submitting

- Change this file (README.md) and style it to showcase your solution (gifs, explanations, link to the github page, links to resources you used, etc...)
- Submit your solution repo to the [ChallengeMe](http://challengeme.suvelocity.org/) system
- Submit your repo link and github page and video to Google Classroom
- Record a 5-10 min selfie video, describe yourself in a few words (age, location, military background, technological background). Also, talk about the solution you submitted (try to explain how your app works in general and which bonuses you added). Think about this video as an interview.

GOOD LUCK!
